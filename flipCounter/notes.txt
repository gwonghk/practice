Hints
- ask your peer if they can think of a way to avoid creating new DOM elements
- ask your peer to describe how they might achieve the flip effect, prior to actually writing the code
- suggest to have separate “up” and “down” elements for each digit component, to achieve the flip transition

Answer
- all the digits are available in the markup, and are re-used in place.
- note the usage of the same basic count function for both the ones and the tens digits.
- we’re using the z-index property to show the currently active digit.
- we’re using the :first-child and :last-child attributes to handle the first and last digit.
- we’re defining custom animations to transition between the z-index as well as to perform the actual transformation.
